# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this study guide to help myself and others organize the information that we learn during the bootcamp. There are several people like myself that have never coded so I created a way for the layman to understand, process, and utilize what we learn in class. Throughout this project I learned that coding isn't that bad once you adapt computational thinking.

## Installation

## Usage

I have included notes for 4 topics:  HTML, CSS, GIT, and JavaScript. The best way to use this guide is to find out what section you have questions about and navigate to it. I tried to breakdown the coding jargon into common language so that anyone can understand the information.
